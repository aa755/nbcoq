Coq plugin for Netbeans

Installation:

There is an easier way to install, but I haven't tested it yet. So here
are the complicated instructions:

Download netbeans+java bundle
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7-netbeans-download-432126.html

Open netbeans. Click on team | git and clone this repo.
It will find this netbeans project and ask if you wish to open it.
Say yes.
Add http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/xom-1.2.10.jar to the classpath
(one way is to right click project and add to libraries)

click run or debug .. it will open another instance of netbeans.
(alternatively, right click project and click Install in Development IDE to avoid running 2 instances)


Better installation instructions (using packaged .nbm file)
and a video demo coming soon (hopefully by next weekend).
